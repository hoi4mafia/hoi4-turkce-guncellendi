Mexico's history of rebellions by regional warlords seemed to be dying out.

The matter passed to an arbitration committee and eventually went to the courts, with the burning question being whether the oil firms could afford the higher wages.\n\nAccording to recent investigations, the Mexican subsidiaries make even more profit than oil companies in the United States, but still refuse to come to an agreement with the workers.

 mexico.18.desc:0 "The election campaign for the next President is due to begin in the next few days. The 1933 constitutional reform was introduced in response to anger at the idea of Calles becoming president for a second term, and after the outright assassination of Calles' predecessor, Álvaro Obregón, who sought such a second term. This reform prevents an elected official serving twice, even if he was only an interim or provisional caretaker. This helps prevent a repeat of the Porfiriato, which saw dictator Porfirio Díaz serve seven terms in a thirty year period and inspired the 1910 Mexican Revolution, plunging the country into a decade of civil strife.\n\nThis law has the benefit of making patronage networks outside the party more difficult to sustain, but also prevents officials being directly accountable to electors, as they will move to a different tier of government after their term, making them reliant on patronage within the party."

General outrage has ensued on the grounds that, as King, and being the head of the Church of England, Edward cannot marry a divorcée.\n\nThe King, however, has made it abundantly clear that he is very much in love with Mrs. Simpson, and intends to marry her regardless of the opinions of his governments or his subjects. As such, only three options remain open to him.\n\nThe British government and the governments of the Dominions have already stated that any alternative to abdication would be unacceptable, and repercussions of trying to force through a marriage, even an attempted compromise, would likely be dire, not only for Britain itself, but also for its ties to the Commonwealth. As the King's closest advisers continue their attempts to convince him, the public awaits with bated breath the resolution of this conflict between the King and his cabinet."
